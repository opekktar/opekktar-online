I worked in IT from 1998 to 2014, cutting my teeth on AIX, Solaris, DEC, HP-UX, AS400, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, BSD, Linux of most distributions, working as Systems Admin, Network Engineer, Recovery Specialist, and Data Center Manager. I would love to get back into the industry again, but realize at my age that will never happen.<br>
Iâ€™m transgender and transitioned from (M) to (F) in 2012. But I have decided to <a href="/blog/2022/07/01/why-de-transition/">de-transition</a> back to (M).
